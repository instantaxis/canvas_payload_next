# Task: Audit Existing Data Fetching Patterns

## Overview
This task involves a thorough audit of all existing data-fetching implementations in the codebase. The goal is to identify and document current patterns, flagging any instances that lack proper pagination, SSR support, or caching strategies, and to verify authentication token handling.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses TanStack Query for all data fetching, with a focus on server-side rendering (SSR), caching, and optimistic updates.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **TanStack Query**: Core library for data fetching and server state management.
- **Payload CMS**: Backend providing the REST and GraphQL APIs.

### Best Practices
- **Authentication-Aware Queries**: Ensure that all queries that require authentication correctly include the user's token.
- **Pagination**: Use server-side pagination for large datasets to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **Caching**: Implement a sensible caching strategy to reduce unnecessary network requests.
- **SSR**: Leverage Next.js's SSR capabilities to pre-fetch data on the server for faster initial page loads.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 29.1
**Title**: Audit Existing Data Fetching Patterns
**Description**: Identify and document all current data-fetching implementations across the codebase, mapping each useQuery/useMutation hook to its API endpoint. Flag instances lacking pagination, SSR support, or caching strategies, and verify authentication token handling in query functions.
**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Data Fetching Catalog**: A comprehensive list of all data-fetching implementations is created, including the hooks used, the API endpoints they call, and their current caching and pagination strategies.
2.  **Issue Identification**: A report is generated that identifies all data-fetching implementations that are not following best practices, with clear recommendations for improvement.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The catalog and issue report are reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
    - A plan is created for addressing the identified issues in a prioritized manner.
