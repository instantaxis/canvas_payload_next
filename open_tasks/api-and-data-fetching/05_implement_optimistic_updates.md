# Task: Implement Optimistic Updates

## Overview
This task focuses on improving the user experience for mutations by implementing optimistic updates. This will involve using the `onMutate` handler in TanStack Query to update the UI before the server has responded.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses TanStack Query for all data fetching, with a focus on server-side rendering (SSR), caching, and optimistic updates.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **TanStack Query**: Core library for data fetching and server state management.

### Best Practices
- **`onMutate`**: Use the `onMutate` handler to optimistically update the local cache before a mutation is sent to the server.
- **Rollback on Error**: Implement the `onError` handler to roll back the optimistic update if the mutation fails.
- **High-Frequency Mutations**: Prioritize implementing optimistic updates for high-frequency mutations, such as updating an order status or submitting a form that requires immediate feedback.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 29.5
**Title**: Implement Optimistic Updates
**Description**: Improve user experience for mutations by adding onMutate handlers to rollback failed updates, focusing on high-frequency mutations such as order status updates and forms requiring immediate feedback.
**Dependencies**: [29.4]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **`onMutate` Implementation**: The `onMutate` handler is implemented for all high-frequency mutations.
2.  **Rollback Implementation**: The `onError` handler is implemented to roll back the optimistic update if the mutation fails.
3.  **Testing**:
    - Perform a mutation and verify that the UI updates instantly, before the server responds.
    - Manually force a mutation to fail (e.g., by disconnecting from the network) and verify that the UI correctly rolls back to its previous state.
    - Verify that the cache is correctly updated on a successful mutation.
