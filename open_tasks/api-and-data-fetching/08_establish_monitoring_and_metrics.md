# Task: Establish Monitoring and Metrics

## Overview
This task focuses on tracking data-fetching performance by implementing query logging, tracking cache hit/miss ratios, and setting up performance alerts for slow queries.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses TanStack Query for all data fetching, with a focus on server-side rendering (SSR), caching, and optimistic updates.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **TanStack Query**: Core library for data fetching and server state management.
- **Sentry, Datadog, or similar**: (Recommended) for performance monitoring and alerting.

### Best Practices
- **Query Logging**: Log all queries in development to help with debugging and performance tuning.
- **Cache Hit/Miss Ratio**: Track the cache hit/miss ratio to understand the effectiveness of your caching strategy.
- **Performance Alerts**: Set up alerts for slow queries so that you can proactively address performance issues.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 29.8
**Title**: Establish Monitoring and Metrics
**Description**: Track data-fetching performance by implementing query logging in development, tracking cache hit/miss ratios, and setting up performance alerts for slow queries, connecting to the existing logging system.
**Dependencies**: [29.7]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Query Logging**: Query logging is implemented in the development environment.
2.  **Cache Metrics**: The cache hit/miss ratio is tracked and sent to a monitoring service.
3.  **Performance Alerts**: Alerts are configured to trigger when a query exceeds a certain time threshold.
4.  **Testing**:
    - Verify that queries are being logged in the development console.
    - Check the monitoring service to confirm that cache metrics are being received.
    - Intentionally introduce a slow query and verify that a performance alert is triggered.
