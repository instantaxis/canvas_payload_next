# Task: Optimize Pagination Strategies

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing smooth and efficient pagination for large datasets. This will involve using `keepPreviousData` for a better user experience and implementing cursor-based pagination for performance.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses TanStack Query for all data fetching, with a focus on server-side rendering (SSR), caching, and optimistic updates.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **TanStack Query**: Core library for data fetching and server state management.
- **Payload CMS**: Backend providing the REST and GraphQL APIs.

### Best Practices
- **`keepPreviousData`**: Use the `keepPreviousData` option in `useQuery` to keep the previous page's data visible while the next page is being fetched. This prevents a jarring loading state.
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: For very large datasets, use cursor-based pagination instead of offset-based pagination. This is more performant as it avoids the need for the database to count all previous records.
- **UI Skeletons**: Show UI skeletons or other loading indicators to provide feedback to the user while new pages are being fetched.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 29.3
**Title**: Optimize Pagination Strategies
**Description**: Implement smooth paginated data loading using keepPreviousData, cursor-based pagination for large datasets, and UI skeletons during transitions for collections with more than 50 items.
**Dependencies**: [29.2]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **`keepPreviousData` Implementation**: The `keepPreviousData` option is enabled on all paginated queries.
2.  **Cursor-Based Pagination**: For all collections with more than 50 items, pagination is implemented using a cursor-based approach.
3.  **UI Skeletons**: UI skeletons are displayed while new pages are being fetched.
4.  **Testing**:
    - Navigate through a paginated list and verify that the previous page's data remains visible while the next page is loading.
    - Inspect the network requests to confirm that cursor-based pagination is being used for large collections.
    - Verify that UI skeletons are displayed correctly during page transitions.
