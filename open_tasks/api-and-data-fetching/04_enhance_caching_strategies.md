# Task: Enhance Caching Strategies

## Overview
This task focuses on reducing unnecessary network requests by defining granular query keys, setting appropriate cache lifetimes, and implementing automatic garbage collection.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses TanStack Query for all data fetching, with a focus on server-side rendering (SSR), caching, and optimistic updates.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **TanStack Query**: Core library for data fetching and server state management.

### Best Practices
- **Granular Query Keys**: Use specific and descriptive query keys to avoid cache collisions and ensure that data is refetched only when necessary.
- **Cache Lifetimes**: Set the `staleTime` and `cacheTime` for each query based on how frequently the data is expected to change.
- **Garbage Collection**: TanStack Query's garbage collection will automatically remove unused queries from the cache.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 29.4
**Title**: Enhance Caching Strategies
**Description**: Reduce network requests by defining granular query keys, setting cache lifetimes based on data volatility, and implementing automatic garbage collection.
**Dependencies**: [29.3]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Granular Query Keys**: All queries use granular, unique keys that accurately reflect their data dependencies.
2.  **Cache Lifetimes**: The `staleTime` and `cacheTime` are set to appropriate values for all queries.
3.  **Testing**:
    - Use the TanStack Query Devtools to inspect the query cache and verify that keys are being generated correctly.
    - Verify that data is being cached and refetched as expected based on the configured lifetimes.
    - Confirm that unused queries are being garbage collected from the cache.
