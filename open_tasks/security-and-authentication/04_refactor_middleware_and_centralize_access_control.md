# Task: Refactor Middleware and Centralize Access Control

## Overview
This task involves refactoring the existing middleware into modular components and centralizing all access control logic into a single, reusable module. This will improve the maintainability and security of the application.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a Payload CMS backend for data management and a Next.js frontend for the user interface. Authentication is handled through JWTs with secure cookies.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Payload CMS**: Core backend and authentication provider.

### Best Practices
- **Modular Middleware**: Break down large middleware files into smaller, single-purpose modules (e.g., `authMiddleware.ts`, `rateLimitingMiddleware.ts`). This improves readability and reusability.
- **Centralized Access Control**: Create a single module that handles all role-based access control (RBAC) logic. This ensures that access control rules are consistent and easy to manage.
- **Audit Logging**: Integrate audit logging to track all access control decisions and other sensitive operations.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 26.4
**Title**: Refactor Middleware and Centralize Access Control
**Description**: Refactor authentication, validation, and rate limiting into modular middleware. Implement centralized access control and audit logging.
**Dependencies**: [26.3]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Modular Middleware**: The existing `middleware.ts` file is broken down into smaller, more focused middleware modules.
2.  **Centralized RBAC**: A new `rbac.ts` module is created that exports functions for checking user roles and permissions. All access control checks throughout the application are updated to use this module.
3.  **Audit Logging**: An audit logging system is integrated to log all significant events, such as failed login attempts and access control decisions.
4.  **Testing**:
    - Unit tests are written for the new RBAC module to verify that it correctly enforces permissions.
    - Integration tests are written to verify that the new middleware pipeline works as expected.
    - Manually test various user roles and permissions to ensure that access control is working correctly across the application.
