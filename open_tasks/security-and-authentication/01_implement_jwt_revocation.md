# Task: Implement JWT Revocation Mechanism

## Overview
This task involves creating a mechanism to revoke JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This is a critical security feature to ensure that compromised or logged-out user tokens cannot be used to access protected resources.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a Payload CMS backend for data management and a Next.js frontend for the user interface. Authentication is handled through JWTs with secure cookies.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Payload CMS**: Core backend and authentication provider.
- **Redis**: (or a similar in-memory store) is recommended for maintaining a blacklist of revoked tokens.

### Best Practices
- **JWT Revocation**: A common pattern is to maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens. When a user logs out or changes their password, their token's unique identifier (e.g., `jti` claim) is added to the blacklist.
- **Token Expiry**: The blacklist should have a Time-To-Live (TTL) that matches the JWT's expiration time to prevent the list from growing indefinitely.
- **Middleware**: The token validation middleware should be updated to check against the blacklist.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 26.1
**Title**: Implement JWT Revocation Mechanism
**Description**: Create a JWT token blacklist mechanism using Redis cache and update authentication middleware to check token status.
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Implement Blacklist**: Set up a Redis cache (or alternative) to store revoked JWT identifiers.
2.  **Update Logout**: When a user logs out, their JWT's `jti` is added to the blacklist with a TTL matching the token's expiry.
3.  **Update Middleware**: The authentication middleware is updated to check if a token's `jti` is in the blacklist. If it is, the request is rejected with a 401 Unauthorized status.
4.  **Testing**:
    - A user logs in and receives a JWT.
    - The user accesses a protected route successfully.
    - The user logs out.
    - The user attempts to access the protected route again with the same JWT and is denied access.
