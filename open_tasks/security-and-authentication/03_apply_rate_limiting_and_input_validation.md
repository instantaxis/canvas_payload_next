# Task: Apply Rate Limiting and Input Validation

## Overview
This task involves implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints and ensuring that all user input is validated against a strict schema.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a Payload CMS backend for data management and a Next.js frontend for the user interface. Authentication is handled through JWTs with secure cookies.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Payload CMS**: Core backend and authentication provider.
- **Zod**: For schema validation.
- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: A common algorithm for rate limiting. Libraries like `express-rate-limit` can be used.

### Best Practices
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to sensitive endpoints, especially authentication routes, to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Input Validation**: All data from external sources (API requests, forms) should be validated against a Zod schema to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 26.3
**Title**: Apply Rate Limiting and Input Validation
**Description**: Integrate a token bucket rate limiter for API routes and create input validation middleware using Zod schemas.
**Dependencies**: [26.2]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Implement Rate Limiting**: A rate limiter is applied to all authentication-related API routes (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/password-reset-request`).
2.  **Implement Input Validation**: A middleware is created that uses Zod schemas to validate the body of all incoming POST and PUT requests.
3.  **Testing**:
    - Send multiple requests to a rate-limited endpoint in quick succession and verify that a 429 Too Many Requests error is returned after the limit is exceeded.
    - Send a request with an invalid body to an endpoint protected by the validation middleware and verify that a 400 Bad Request error is returned with a descriptive error message.
    - Send a valid request and verify that it is processed successfully.
