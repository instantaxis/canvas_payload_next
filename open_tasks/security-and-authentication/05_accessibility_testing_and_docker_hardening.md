# Task: Accessibility, Testing, and Docker Security Hardening

## Overview
This task focuses on improving the overall quality and security of the application by conducting accessibility testing, implementing automated security tests, and hardening the Docker configuration.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application is containerized using Docker for development and deployment.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing, including accessibility checks.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Snyk or Trivy**: (Recommended) for container image vulnerability scanning.

### Best Practices
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities by following WCAG guidelines. Automated tools can catch many issues, but manual testing is also necessary.
- **Security Testing**: Integrate automated security scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early.
- **Docker Security**: Follow best practices for building secure Docker images, such as using minimal base images, running as a non-root user, and scanning for vulnerabilities.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 26.5
**Title**: Accessibility, Testing, and Docker Security Hardening
**Description**: Conduct accessibility testing, implement automated security tests, and harden Docker configuration.
**Dependencies**: [26.4]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Accessibility Audit**: An accessibility audit is performed on the application's forms and main UI components using a tool like Playwright's built-in accessibility checks or Axe. All critical issues are addressed.
2.  **Automated Security Tests**: Automated security tests are added to the CI/CD pipeline. These could include dependency scanning, static application security testing (SAST), and container vulnerability scanning.
3.  **Docker Hardening**: The application's Dockerfile is updated to follow security best practices, including:
    - Using a minimal base image (e.g., `node:18-alpine`).
    - Running the application as a non-root user.
    - Removing unnecessary packages and files from the final image.
4.  **Testing**:
    - The accessibility tests pass in the CI/CD pipeline.
    - The security scanning tools do not report any high-severity vulnerabilities.
    - The Docker image builds successfully and the application runs correctly in the hardened container.
