# Task: Enhance Password and Cookie Security

## Overview
This task focuses on strengthening the security of user passwords and the cookies used for session management. This involves using a strong hashing algorithm for passwords and configuring secure attributes for cookies.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a Payload CMS backend for data management and a Next.js frontend for the user interface. Authentication is handled through JWTs with secure cookies.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Payload CMS**: Core backend and authentication provider.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords.

### Best Practices
- **Password Hashing**: Use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like bcrypt with a sufficient cost factor (e.g., 12 or higher) to protect against brute-force attacks.
- **Secure Cookies**: Configure cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict` attributes. `HttpOnly` prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks. `SameSite=Strict` prevents the browser from sending the cookie along with cross-site requests, mitigating CSRF attacks.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 26.2
**Title**: Enhance Password and Cookie Security
**Description**: Implement bcrypt password hashing with a cost factor of 12 and configure HTTP-only, SameSite strict cookies.
**Dependencies**: [26.1]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Implement bcrypt Hashing**: The user registration and password reset flows use bcrypt with a cost factor of 12 to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
2.  **Configure Secure Cookies**: All authentication-related cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict` attributes.
3.  **Testing**:
    - Create a new user and verify that the password stored in the database is a bcrypt hash.
    - Log in and inspect the session cookie in the browser's developer tools to confirm that the `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes are set correctly.
    - Attempt to access the cookie via JavaScript (`document.cookie`) and verify that it is not accessible.
