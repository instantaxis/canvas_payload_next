# Task: Implement Automated Enforcement of TypeScript Typing Guidelines in Payload

## Overview
This task focuses on setting up and configuring automated linting and documentation generation to enforce TypeScript typing guidelines within the Payload CMS project.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The project emphasizes strong typing and clear documentation to ensure code quality and maintainability.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **ESLint**: For static analysis of code to find problems.
- **TypeScript ESLint**: ESLint plugin for TypeScript.
- **JSDoc/TSDoc**: For code documentation.

### Best Practices
- **Automated Linting**: Integrate ESLint into the development workflow to automatically catch and fix typing issues.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks (e.g., with Husky) to run linting and type checks before code is committed.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Include a linting step in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that no code with typing issues is merged into the main branch.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 18
**Title**: Implement Automated Enforcement of TypeScript Typing Guidelines in Payload
**Description**: Set up and configured automated linting and documentation. Refer to `llm_context/llm_agent_insights/code_documentation_standards.md` for detailed JSDoc/TSDoc standards and usage. For TypeScript typing issues, refer to `llm_context/responses/typescript_errors.md`.
**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: in-progress

## Success Test
1.  **ESLint Configuration**: ESLint is configured with the `typescript-eslint` plugin and rules that enforce the project's typing guidelines.
2.  **Pre-commit Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks are set up to run ESLint on staged files.
3.  **CI/CD Integration**: The CI/CD pipeline is updated to include a linting step that fails the build if any typing issues are found.
4.  **Testing**:
    - Intentionally introduce a TypeScript typing error and verify that the pre-commit hook prevents the code from being committed.
    - Push a branch with a typing error and verify that the CI/CD pipeline fails at the linting step.
    - Verify that the linter correctly identifies and reports on violations of the defined TSDoc/JSDoc standards.
