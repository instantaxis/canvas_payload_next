# Task: Setup Environment Configuration

## Overview
This task involves defining a matrix for environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production), parameterizing environment variables, and implementing configuration validation tests.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application is deployed to multiple environments (development, staging, production).

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **dotenv**: (or similar) for managing environment variables.

### Best Practices
- **Environment-Specific Files**: Use separate configuration files for each environment (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`).
- **Configuration Validation**: Implement a script that validates the environment configuration on application startup to ensure that all required variables are present and correctly formatted.
- **Parameterization**: Avoid hardcoding configuration values. Instead, use environment variables to parameterize the application.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 31.4
**Title**: Environment Configuration Setup
**Description**: Define a matrix for environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production), parameterize environment variables, and implement configuration validation tests.
**Dependencies**: [31.2, 31.3]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Environment Configuration Matrix**: A document is created that defines the configuration for each environment.
2.  **Parameterized Configuration**: All hardcoded configuration values are replaced with environment variables.
3.  **Configuration Validation**: A validation script is implemented that runs on application startup.
4.  **Testing**:
    - The application is deployed to each environment and verified that it is using the correct configuration.
    - The configuration validation script is tested by intentionally introducing an invalid configuration and verifying that the application fails to start.
