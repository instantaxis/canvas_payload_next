# Task: Analyze CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This task involves mapping the existing deployment workflows and identifying any missing checks, particularly those specific to Large Language Models (LLMs), such as automated bias detection and performance benchmarking.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application is deployed using a CI/CD pipeline, likely with GitHub Actions.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: (or similar CI/CD tool)
- **LLM-specific tools**: (to be researched) for bias detection and performance benchmarking.

### Best Practices
- **Comprehensive CI/CD**: A robust CI/CD pipeline should include steps for linting, testing, security scanning, and building before deploying.
- **LLM-Specific Checks**: For applications that use LLMs, it's important to include checks for bias, performance, and prompt injection.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 31.2
**Title**: CI/CD Pipeline Analysis
**Description**: Map existing deployment workflows and identify missing LLM-specific checks, such as automated bias detection, performance benchmarking, and version control for prompts/datasets.
**Dependencies**: [31.1]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Workflow Mapping**: The existing CI/CD pipeline is fully documented, including all steps and their purposes.
2.  **Gap Analysis**: A report is generated that identifies any missing steps in the pipeline, with a focus on LLM-specific checks.
3.  **Recommendations**: A set of recommendations is provided for improving the CI/CD pipeline, including the tools and techniques that can be used to implement the missing checks.
4.  **Testing**:
    - The workflow documentation is reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
    - The gap analysis and recommendations are reviewed to ensure that they are practical and actionable.
