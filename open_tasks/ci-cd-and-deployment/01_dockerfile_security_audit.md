# Task: Dockerfile Security Audit

## Overview
This task involves a thorough security audit of all Dockerfiles in the project. The goal is to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities and to ensure that the Docker images are built according to best practices.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application is containerized using Docker for development and deployment.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Snyk or Trivy**: (Recommended) for container image vulnerability scanning.

### Best Practices
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images (e.g., `node:18-alpine`) to reduce the attack surface.
- **Non-Root User**: Run the application as a non-root user to limit the potential damage of a container breakout.
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Where possible, run the container with a read-only filesystem to prevent modification of the container's contents.
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image small and free of unnecessary build dependencies.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 31.1
**Title**: Dockerfile Security Audit
**Description**: Review all Dockerfiles for security best practices, including non-root user execution, read-only filesystems, minimized image layers, resource limits, and up-to-date base images. Generate a vulnerability report with remediation steps.
**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Dockerfile Audit**: All Dockerfiles are reviewed and updated to follow security best practices.
2.  **Vulnerability Scan**: A vulnerability scan is performed on all Docker images, and all high-severity vulnerabilities are addressed.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The Docker images build successfully after the changes.
    - The application runs correctly in the hardened containers.
    - The vulnerability scanner reports no high-severity vulnerabilities.
