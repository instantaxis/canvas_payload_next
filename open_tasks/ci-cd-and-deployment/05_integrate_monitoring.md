# Task: Integrate Monitoring

## Overview
This task involves implementing container activity logging and setting up a vulnerability alerting system to monitor Docker and CI/CD pipeline security events.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application is deployed using a CI/CD pipeline.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Sentry, Datadog, or similar**: (Recommended) for monitoring and alerting.

### Best Practices
- **Container Logging**: Log all container activity to a centralized logging service.
- **Vulnerability Alerting**: Set up alerts to be notified immediately when new vulnerabilities are discovered in your container images or dependencies.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 31.5
**Title**: Monitoring Integration
**Description**: Implement container activity logging and set up a vulnerability alerting system to monitor Docker and CI/CD pipeline security events.
