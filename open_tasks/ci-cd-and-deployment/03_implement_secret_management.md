# Task: Implement Secret Management

## Overview
This task involves auditing the current secret storage locations, designing and implementing an integration with a dedicated secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault, and ensuring that all secrets are encrypted, rotated, and access is logged.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application is deployed using a CI/CD pipeline.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **HashiCorp Vault**: (or similar) for secret management.
- **Docker**: For containerization.

### Best Practices
- **Centralized Secret Management**: Use a dedicated secret management tool to store all secrets, rather than scattering them across environment variables and configuration files.
- **Encryption at Rest and in Transit**: Ensure that all secrets are encrypted both when they are stored and when they are transmitted over the network.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access control policies to ensure that only authorized applications and users can access secrets.
- **Auditing**: Log all access to secrets to provide a clear audit trail.
