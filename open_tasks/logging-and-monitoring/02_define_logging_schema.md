# Task: Define Logging Schema

## Overview
This task involves designing a standardized log entry schema to be used across all services. This will ensure that logs are consistent and easy to parse, and that they include all necessary information for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a centralized logging solution.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **JSON**: The recommended format for structured logging.

### Best Practices
- **Standardized Schema**: Use a standardized schema for all log entries to ensure consistency.
- **User Context**: Include user context (e.g., user ID, IP address) in all relevant log entries.
- **Payload Diffs**: For mutation logs, include a diff of the data before and after the change.
- **Compliance**: Ensure that the logging schema meets all relevant audit and compliance requirements.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 25.2
**Title**: Define Logging Schema
**Description**: Design a standardized log entry schema to be used across all services, ensuring inclusion of user context, payload diffs for mutations, and compliance with audit requirements.
**Dependencies**: [25.1]

## Success Test
1.  **Logging Schema Definition**: A document is created that defines the standardized logging schema.
2.  **Schema Review**: The schema is reviewed to ensure that it meets all requirements.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The schema is used to create a sample log entry, which is then reviewed for correctness and completeness.
