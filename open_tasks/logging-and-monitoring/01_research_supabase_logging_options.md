# Task: Research Supabase Logging Options

## Overview
This task involves investigating Supabase's native logging capabilities and evaluating Log Drains for exporting logs to external systems. This research will inform the design of a centralized logging solution.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses Supabase for its database and other backend services.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Supabase**: The backend-as-a-service provider.
- **Datadog, Sentry, or similar**: (Potential) external logging systems.

### Best Practices
- **Centralized Logging**: Consolidate logs from all services into a single, searchable location.
- **Structured Logging**: Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) to make logs easier to parse and analyze.
- **Log Levels**: Use different log levels (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`) to categorize logs and filter them effectively.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 25.1
**Title**: Research Supabase Logging Options
**Description**: Investigate Supabase's native logging capabilities (Logs Explorer) for auth, database, storage, and realtime logs. Evaluate Log Drains for exporting logs to external systems such as Datadog, including compliance and integration with custom HTTP endpoints.
**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Supabase Logging Capabilities Documented**: A document is created that details Supabase's native logging capabilities, including the types of logs available and how to access them.
2.  **Log Drain Evaluation**: A report is generated that evaluates the feasibility of using Supabase Log Drains to export logs to an external system. The report should include a comparison of different external logging systems.
3.  **Recommendations**: A set of recommendations is provided for the best approach to implementing a centralized logging solution.
