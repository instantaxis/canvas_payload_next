# Task: Assess Dynamic Fields and File Upload Workflows

## Overview
This task involves evaluating the implementation of dynamic field arrays and file upload components to ensure they are robust, secure, and provide a good user experience.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a robust form system built with React Hook Form, Zod for validation, and Zustand for state management.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **React Hook Form**: Core form library, specifically `useFieldArray`.
- **react-dropzone**: For the file upload UI.
- **Payload CMS**: For handling the backend of file uploads.

### Best Practices
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Use the `id` provided by `useFieldArray` as the key for each item in the array to ensure proper re-rendering.
- **File Uploads**: Provide immediate feedback to the user, such as upload progress indicators and previews of the selected files. Handle upload errors gracefully.
- **Security**: For file uploads, implement server-side validation of file types and sizes, and consider virus scanning.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 28.3
**Title**: Assess Dynamic Fields and File Upload Workflows
**Description**: Evaluate dynamic field arrays and file upload implementations. Check `useFieldArray` usage (Section 2), conditional fields, and file uploads using `react-dropzone` (Section 6). Integrate Payload upload hooks from `README.md` and add upload progress indicators. Output a standardized upload component with test cases.
**Dependencies**: [28.2]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **`useFieldArray` Audit**: All usages of `useFieldArray` are reviewed to ensure they are correctly implemented, especially in conjunction with conditional fields.
2.  **File Upload Workflow Review**: The end-to-end file upload workflow is tested, from the user selecting a file to the file being successfully stored in the backend.
3.  **Standardized Upload Component**: A standardized, reusable file upload component is created that includes progress indicators, file previews, and error handling.
4.  **Testing**:
    - Unit tests are written for the new standardized upload component.
    - Integration tests are written to verify the complete file upload workflow.
    - Manual testing is performed to ensure a smooth user experience for both dynamic fields and file uploads.
