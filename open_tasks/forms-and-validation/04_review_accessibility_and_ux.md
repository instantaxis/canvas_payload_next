# Task: Review Accessibility and User Experience Across All Forms

## Overview
This task involves conducting a thorough accessibility audit of all forms in the application to ensure they comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The goal is to identify and fix any accessibility issues to provide a better user experience for all users.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a robust form system built with React Hook Form, Zod for validation, and Zustand for state management.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing, including accessibility checks.
- **Axe**: A popular accessibility testing tool that can be integrated with Playwright.

### Best Practices
- **ARIA Roles**: Use appropriate ARIA roles and attributes to make forms accessible to screen readers (e.g., `aria-invalid`, `role="alert"`).
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all form controls are focusable and can be operated using only the keyboard.
- **Contrast Ratios**: Check that all text and UI elements have sufficient color contrast.
