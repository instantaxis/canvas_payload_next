# Task: Review and Validate Form Composition, State, and Validation Layers

## Overview
This task focuses on assessing all forms for proper validation and state management. The goal is to audit Zod schema refinements, test async validation, and verify error handling.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a robust form system built with React Hook Form, Zod for validation, and Zustand for state management.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **React Hook Form**: Core form library.
- **Zod**: Schema validation.
- **Zustand**: State management for complex forms.

### Best Practices
- **Zod Refinements**: Use Zod's `.refine()` method to enforce cross-field validation logic.
- **Async Validation**: Implement debouncing for async validation to avoid excessive server requests.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear and immediate user feedback for validation errors.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 28.2
**Title**: Review and Validate Form Composition, State, and Validation Layers
**Description**: Assess all forms for proper validation and state management. Audit Zod schema refinements for cross-field logic (Section 3), test async validation debouncing (Section 5), and verify error handling matches `README.md` UX patterns. Produce a validation deficiency matrix with remediation priorities.
**Dependencies**: [28.1]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Zod Schema Audit**: All Zod schemas are reviewed to ensure that they correctly implement cross-field validation using `.refine()`.
2.  **Async Validation Testing**: All forms with asynchronous validation are tested to ensure that debouncing is working correctly and that server errors are handled gracefully.
3.  **Error Handling Verification**: The error handling for all forms is tested to ensure that it matches the UX patterns defined in the project's `README.md`.
4.  **Validation Deficiency Matrix**: A document is produced that lists all identified validation issues, their severity, and a prioritized plan for remediation.
