# Task: Audit and Catalog All Form Implementations Against Project Patterns

## Overview
This task involves a comprehensive audit of all existing form implementations in the codebase. The goal is to catalog each form, assess its compliance with established project patterns, and produce a gap analysis report.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a robust form system built with React Hook Form, Zod for validation, and Zustand for state management.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **React Hook Form**: Core form library.
- **Zod**: Schema validation.
- **Zustand**: State management for complex forms.

### Best Practices
- **Schema Isolation**: Define separate Zod schemas for each step in multi-step forms and merge them for final validation.
- **State Management**: Use `FormProvider` and `useFormContext` for nested form components. Use Zustand for persisting form state across sessions or complex multi-step flows.
- **Conditional Fields**: Use `watch` to monitor field values and conditionally render other fields. Unregister fields when they are hidden to avoid validation errors.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 28.1
**Title**: Audit and Catalog All Form Implementations Against Project Patterns
**Description**: Catalog all form implementations in the codebase, referencing `complex_forms.md` for pattern compliance. Validate multi-step isolation using step schema merging (Section 1), dynamic field arrays with `useFieldArray` (Section 2), and conditional field handling via `watch`/`unregister` (Section 3). Output a gap analysis report with compliance status for each form.
**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Form Catalog**: A comprehensive list of all forms in the application is created, including their location in the codebase and their purpose.
2.  **Compliance Check**: Each form is checked against the patterns defined in `llm_context/forms/complex_forms.md`.
3.  **Gap Analysis Report**: A report is generated that details the compliance status of each form and identifies any deviations from the established patterns.
4.  **Testing**:
    - The catalog is reviewed for completeness and accuracy.
    - The gap analysis report is reviewed to ensure that it correctly identifies all non-compliant forms and provides clear recommendations for remediation.
