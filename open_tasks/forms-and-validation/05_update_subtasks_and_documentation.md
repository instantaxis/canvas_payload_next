# Task: Update Subtasks, Expand Testing, and Synchronize Documentation

## Overview
This task involves updating all form-related subtasks based on the findings from the previous audits, expanding test coverage, and ensuring that all documentation is synchronized with the latest changes.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses a robust form system built with React Hook Form, Zod for validation, and Zustand for state management.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Vitest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing.
- **Taskmaster**: For task management.

### Best Practices
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage for all form-related logic, including unit tests for Zod schemas, integration tests for form components, and end-to-end tests for complex user flows.
- **Documentation**: Keep all documentation, including `README.md` files and task descriptions, up-to-date with the latest implementation details and best practices.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 28.5
**Title**: Update Subtasks, Expand Testing, and Synchronize Documentation
**Description**: Based on previous findings, update all subtasks, expand test coverage (Playwright for multi-step flows, Vitest for Zod schema, accessibility regression tests), and synchronize documentation. Map findings to `complex_forms.md`, add new examples to `README.md`, and create a troubleshooting guide.
**Dependencies**: [28.4]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Subtask Updates**: All form-related subtasks in Taskmaster are updated to reflect the findings from the audits.
2.  **Expanded Test Coverage**: New tests are added to cover all aspects of the form system, including multi-step flows, Zod schemas, and accessibility.
3.  **Synchronized Documentation**: The `complex_forms.md` and `README.md` files are updated with the latest information, and a new troubleshooting guide is created.
4.  **Testing**:
    - All new and existing tests pass in the CI/CD pipeline.
    - The updated documentation is reviewed for accuracy and clarity.
