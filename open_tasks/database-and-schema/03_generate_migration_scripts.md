# Task: Generate Migration Scripts for Supabase

## Overview
This task involves creating SQL migration scripts to synchronize the Supabase database schema with the Payload CMS data model. These scripts will be based on the differences documented in the delta report from the previous task.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses Payload CMS for its data models and Supabase as its underlying database.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **SQL**: For writing the migration scripts.
- **Supabase CLI**: For applying the migrations.

### Best Practices
- **Idempotent Scripts**: Write migration scripts that are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing errors.
- **Transactional Migrations**: Wrap migrations in a transaction to ensure that they are applied atomically.
- **Reversible Migrations**: For each migration, create a corresponding "down" migration that can be used to revert the changes.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 32.3
**Title**: Generate Migration Scripts for Supabase
**Description**: Based on the documented differences, create SQL migration scripts to synchronize Supabase's schema with Payload's data model. Scripts should handle table/column creation, type conversions, and constraint synchronization.
**Dependencies**: [32.2]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Migration Scripts**: SQL migration scripts are created to address all the differences identified in the delta report.
2.  **Down Migrations**: For each migration script, a corresponding "down" migration is created.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The migration scripts are reviewed for correctness and completeness.
    - The scripts are tested on a development database to ensure that they work as expected.
