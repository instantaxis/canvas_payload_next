# Task: Analyze and Document Schema Differences

## Overview
This task involves performing a structural and constraint-based comparison between the exported Payload and Supabase schemas. The goal is to generate a delta report identifying all discrepancies.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses Payload CMS for its data models and Supabase as its underlying database.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Schema comparison tools**: (e.g., `diff`, `pgdiff`) can be used to automate the comparison process.

### Best Practices
- **Structural Comparison**: Compare tables, columns, and data types.
- **Constraint Comparison**: Compare primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and other constraints.
- **Detailed Reporting**: The delta report should be detailed enough to be used as a basis for generating migration scripts.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 32.2
**Title**: Analyze and Document Schema Differences
**Description**: Perform a structural and constraint-based comparison between the exported Payload and Supabase schemas. Generate a delta report identifying missing tables, field type mismatches (e.g., `richText` vs `TEXT`), relationship inconsistencies, and constraint differences.
**Dependencies**: [32.1]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Schema Comparison**: A thorough comparison of the two schemas is performed.
2.  **Delta Report**: A delta report is generated that clearly documents all differences between the two schemas.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The delta report is reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
    - The report is used to manually verify a subset of the identified differences.
