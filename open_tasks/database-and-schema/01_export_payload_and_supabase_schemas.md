# Task: Export Payload and Supabase Schemas

## Overview
This task involves extracting the current schema definitions from both Payload CMS and Supabase. This is the first step in identifying and resolving any discrepancies between the two schemas.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses Payload CMS for its data models and Supabase as its underlying database.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Payload CMS**: For exporting the schema as JSON.
- **Supabase CLI**: For dumping the database schema.

### Best Practices
- **Schema-Only Dump**: When exporting the Supabase schema, use the `--schema-only` flag to avoid exporting any data.
- **Filtering**: Filter the Supabase schema dump to include only the relevant schemas (e.g., `public`).

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 32.1
**Title**: Export Payload and Supabase Schemas
**Description**: Extract the current schema definitions from both Payload CMS and Supabase. For Payload, use the `dump` command to export the schema as JSON, referencing collections, fields, and relationships as defined in `llm_context/payload3/data_models.md`. For Supabase, use `pg_dump --schema-only` via the Supabase CLI, filtering to relevant schemas.
**Dependencies**: []
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Payload Schema Export**: The Payload CMS schema is successfully exported as a JSON file.
2.  **Supabase Schema Export**: The Supabase database schema is successfully exported as a SQL file.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The exported Payload schema is reviewed to ensure that it accurately reflects the collections and fields defined in the codebase.
    - The exported Supabase schema is reviewed to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of the database.
