# Task: Apply and Validate Migrations on Supabase

## Overview
This task involves applying the generated migration scripts to the Supabase database and validating that the resulting schema is correct.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses Payload CMS for its data models and Supabase as its underlying database.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Supabase CLI**: For applying the migrations.
- **Payload CMS**: For validating the schema.

### Best Practices
- **Pre-Execution Checks**: Before applying migrations, use `supabase migration lint` to check for any potential issues.
- **Atomic Migrations**: Apply migrations atomically to ensure that the database is not left in an inconsistent state.
- **Schema Validation**: After applying migrations, use Payload's `validate` command to ensure that the database schema is in sync with the Payload collections.
