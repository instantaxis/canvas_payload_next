# Task: Document and Version-Control Schema Changes

## Overview
This task involves committing the updated `schema.sql`, Payload configs, and migration scripts to the project's Git repository. This will ensure that all schema changes are version-controlled and can be easily tracked and reverted if necessary.

## Context & Information
### Application Details
- **Stack**: Payload CMS backend with NextJS frontend
- **Architecture**: The application uses Git for version control.

### Relevant Libraries & Tools
- **Git**: For version control.

### Best Practices
- **Clear Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the schema changes.
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single, logical change to the schema.
- **Reverse Migrations**: For each migration, include a corresponding "down" migration that can be used to revert the changes.

## Task to Complete

### Task ID: 32.5
**Title**: Document and Version-Control Schema Changes
**Description**: Commit the updated `schema.sql`, Payload configs, and migration scripts to the project's Git repository. Include a clear commit message and store reverse migration scripts for rollback capability.
**Dependencies**: [32.4]
**Status**: pending

## Success Test
1.  **Git Commit**: All schema-related changes are committed to the Git repository with a clear and descriptive commit message.
2.  **Rollback Capability**: For each migration, a corresponding "down" migration is created and committed.
3.  **Testing**:
    - The Git history is reviewed to ensure that all schema changes are correctly version-controlled.
    - A "down" migration is tested on a development database to verify that it correctly reverts the schema changes.
