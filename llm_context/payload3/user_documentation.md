## Using the Rich Text Editor (Lexical WYSIWYG)

Several fields in Payload CMS, such as `Employee Notes` in Employee Ratings, `Message Content` and `Internal Notes` in Messages, and `Description` and `Notes` in Upgrades, use a powerful **Rich Text Editor**. This editor allows you to format text, add headings, lists, links, and more, similar to a word processor.
