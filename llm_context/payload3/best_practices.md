# Payload 3 Best Practices

## Collection Design
- [x] Field type selection strategies - Define collections in separate files and import into main config
- [x] Relationship modeling patterns - Use bi-directional relationships with join fields
- [x] Access control implementation - Granular access rules in collection configs
- [x] Validation rule patterns - Zod schema validation with custom errors
- [x] Index optimization - Indexes for frequently queried fields

## API Usage
- [x] REST vs GraphQL decision criteria - REST for simplicity, GraphQL for complex data
- [x] Query optimization techniques - Depth parameters and selective fields
- [x] Pagination strategies - Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- [x] Error handling patterns - Standardized error responses
- [x] Authentication integration - JWT with refresh tokens

## Lexical Editor
- [x] Custom block creation - Implement through plugin development
- [x] Plugin development patterns - Extend core functionality with custom plugins
- [x] Content serialization - Server-side serialization for storage
- [x] Editor state management - Debounced updates for performance
- [x] Performance optimization - Virtualized rendering for large documents

## Performance
- [x] Database query optimization - Indexing and query profiling
- [x] Caching strategies - Implement caching for frequent queries
- [x] Image optimization - Built-in transformations and CDN delivery
- [x] Bundle size management - Code splitting and dynamic imports
- [x] Server-side rendering - Next.js SSR for faster initial loads

## Security
- [x] Access control patterns - Role-based access with inheritance
- [x] Input validation - Schema-based validation for all inputs
- [x] File upload security - Type validation and virus scanning
- [x] API rate limiting - Token bucket algorithm
- [x] Authentication best practices - Multi-factor authentication
- [x] Login security - Implement `maxLoginAttempts` and `lockTime` to prevent brute force attacks[1]
- [x] CSRF prevention - Enable CSRF protection for all API endpoints[1][5]
- [x] Session management - Use HttpOnly cookies for authentication tokens[5]
- [x] Environment security - Store sensitive data in environment variables[3]
- [x] Data encryption - Always use HTTPS for data transmission[3]
- [x] Audit logging - Implement detailed audit logs for all admin actions using plugins like `payload-auditor`[1][4]
  - Configure specific operations to log (create/update/delete)[1]
  - Set automated log cleanup with retention policies[1]
  - Include user information and payload details in logs[4]
  - Restrict access to audit logs using access control[1]
