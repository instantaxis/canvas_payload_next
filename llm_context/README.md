# LLM Context Library

This comprehensive context library serves as a central knowledge base for LLM agents working on this Payload 3 + Next.js project. It provides structured documentation, best practices, and actionable guidance across all major technologies and tools used in the project.

## üìÅ Library Structure

### Core Technologies
- **[payload3/](./payload3/)** - Payload 3 CMS, Lexical Editor, and data modeling
- **[tanstack/](./tanstack/)** - Query and Tables for data management
- **[forms/](./forms/)** - Form submission patterns and validation
- **[ui_patterns/](./ui_patterns/)** - Shadcn UI consistency and patterns
- **[state_management/](./state_management/)** - Zustand global state patterns

### Development Tools & Workflows
- **[mcp_tools/](./mcp_tools/)** - MCP server tools and integration guides
- **[llm_agent_insights/](./llm_agent_insights/)** - Agent-specific considerations and patterns

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

Each directory contains:
- **README.md** - Overview and quick reference
- **best_practices.md** - Proven patterns and approaches
- **common_patterns.md** - Frequently used code patterns
- **troubleshooting.md** - Common issues and solutions
- **integration_guides.md** - How to integrate with other technologies

## üîÑ Maintenance

This library should be updated as:
- New patterns emerge in the codebase
- Dependencies are updated
- Best practices evolve
- New MCP tools are integrated

## üìñ Quick Start

1. Navigate to the relevant technology folder
2. Start with the README.md for overview
3. Check best_practices.md for proven approaches
4. Reference common_patterns.md for code examples
5. Use troubleshooting.md when issues arise
