		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: Next.js project initialization, dependency installation, configuration files setup, folder structure creation, environment variable management, and verification/testing of the setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows well-documented patterns. It involves several discrete steps (project creation, dependency management, config, structure, and verification), each with moderate complexity. Existing subtasks cover most areas, but explicit environment management and more granular verification could be added."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Collection Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: data model/relationship design, create/read/update/delete operations, advanced filtering, batch operations, authentication/access control, and comprehensive testing/optimization.",
			"reasoning": "CRUD with relationship handling, advanced filtering, and modern authentication/access control is moderately complex, especially with Payload CMS and Next.js integration. Requires careful schema and permission design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Payload CMS and Database Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration process into subtasks covering Payload CMS installation, Supabase PostgreSQL setup, environment variable management, initial collection schema design, authentication configuration, type generation, Next.js 15 integration, uploads/media handling, real-time updates, and testing/validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex integration between Payload CMS and Supabase PostgreSQL, advanced configuration (auth, real-time, uploads), and adherence to best practices with Next.js 15. It touches multiple architectural layers and requires careful setup and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the authentication system into subtasks for configuration, registration, login, JWT/cookie handling, middleware, RBAC, session management, password reset, security hardening, Next.js integration, useAuth hook, CORS, custom strategies, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need for secure, multi-strategy authentication, integration with both Payload CMS and Next.js 15, RBAC, session management, and extensibility for future providers. Security and correctness are critical."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Form Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for shared Zod schema setup, React Hook Form integration, TanStack Query mutations, Payload CMS submission, error handling, state management, reusable components, Next.js 15 server actions, dynamic form builder, performance optimization, authentication integration, and analytics.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires building a robust, reusable form system with advanced validation, state management, server actions, and integration with multiple libraries and authentication, making it architecturally significant."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Fetching Layer",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for QueryClient setup, SSR hydration, caching, mutation/optimistic updates, authentication-aware querying, server actions, file upload handling, offline support, error/suspense boundaries, Payload CMS API integration, query key management, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to SSR, caching, optimistic updates, offline/background sync, authentication integration, and support for both REST/GraphQL APIs, requiring deep knowledge of TanStack Query and Next.js 15."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Dynamic Form Builder",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for requirements analysis, data structure design, dynamic field rendering, validation mapping, validation logic, form generation, testing, and performance/UX optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Dynamic form generation based on CMS schemas is moderately complex, involving runtime field/validation mapping, performance, and integration with existing form infrastructure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Upload System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Dropzone UI, file state management, Payload CMS media collection setup, upload API handler, TanStack Query mutation, progress UI, media management integration, and security/error handling.",
			"reasoning": "File upload involves UI/UX, backend integration, progress tracking, error handling, and security, but is more contained than core authentication or data fetching layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Role-Based UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for PermissionGate and permission components, role-based navigation, conditional rendering utilities, protected layouts, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "Role-based UI is important for security and UX, but the technical complexity is moderate as it builds on existing authentication and state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Testing Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for Vitest unit test setup, Playwright E2E configuration, API testing with Supertest, React component testing patterns, Payload CMS collection testing, and CI pipeline integration.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing infrastructure is moderately complex, involving multiple tools (unit, E2E, API), CI integration, and coverage for both frontend and backend."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for defining error boundaries, implementing boundaries, integrating monitoring tools, developing notification systems, testing error workflows, and documentation.",
