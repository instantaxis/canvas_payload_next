		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: Next.js project initialization, dependency installation, configuration files setup, folder structure creation, environment variable management, and verification/testing of the setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows well-documented patterns. It involves several discrete steps (project creation, dependency management, config, structure, and verification), each with moderate complexity. Existing subtasks cover most areas, but explicit environment management and more granular verification could be added."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Payload CMS and Database Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: Payload installation, database setup (Supabase/Postgres), environment variable configuration, Payload config best practices, type generation, initial collection schemas, authentication setup, real-time updates, and Next.js integration.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating Payload CMS with a managed Postgres database, type generation, real-time updates, and Next.js 15 patterns requires careful coordination and multiple configuration layers. The need for secure authentication and real-time features increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: auth config, registration, login, JWT/cookie flows, middleware, RBAC, session management, password reset, security hardening, CORS, custom strategy support, frontend hooks/components, and integration with Next.js.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers a full-stack, security-critical authentication system with multiple flows (cookies, JWT, RBAC, session, rate limiting, extensibility). It requires deep integration across backend, frontend, and middleware, justifying a high complexity and many subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Form Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: base form architecture, Zod schema setup, field components, TanStack Query integration, submission logic, state management, server actions, dynamic builder, performance optimizations, error handling, reusable hooks/components, analytics, and auth integration.",
			"reasoning": "Building a robust, reusable, and type-safe form system with shared validation, server actions, optimistic updates, and analytics is complex. It touches many architectural layers and requires careful error/state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Fetching Layer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: QueryClient setup, hydration, caching, CRUD mutations, optimistic updates, auth-aware queries, factory patterns, offline support, error/loading boundaries, and Payload API integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves advanced TanStack Query usage, SSR hydration, optimistic updates, offline sync, and integration with authentication and Payload APIs. It requires architectural decisions and robust error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Dynamic Form Builder",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: requirements analysis, data structure design, rendering engine, validation mapping, validation logic, form generation, testing, and performance/UX optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Dynamically generating forms from CMS schemas with type-safe validation and performance optimizations is non-trivial, requiring careful design and testing, but is bounded in scope compared to full authentication or data layers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Upload System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: Dropzone UI, file state management, Payload media integration, upload handler API, TanStack Query mutation, progress UI, and media management integration.",
			"reasoning": "While file upload involves several moving parts (UI, backend, progress, error handling), the patterns are well-established. Complexity arises from chunked uploads, progress tracking, and Payload integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Collection Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: data model/relationship design, create/read/update/delete operations, advanced filtering, batch operations, authentication/access control, and comprehensive testing/optimization.",
			"reasoning": "CRUD with relationship handling, advanced filtering, and modern authentication/access control is moderately complex, especially with Payload CMS and Next.js integration. Requires careful schema and permission design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Role-Based UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: permission-aware components, navigation guards, protected layouts, and conditional rendering utilities.",
			"reasoning": "Role-based UI logic is conceptually straightforward but must be implemented consistently across components and layouts. Complexity is moderate, mainly in ensuring correct and secure visibility logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Testing Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: Vitest unit test setup, Playwright E2E setup, API testing with Supertest, React component testing patterns, Payload CMS collection tests, and CI pipeline integration.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing infrastructure (unit, integration, E2E, API, CI) is essential and involves multiple tools and best practices. Complexity is moderate due to toolchain integration and coverage requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: error boundary definition, boundary implementation, monitoring tool integration, notification system, workflow testing, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up global error handling and monitoring is moderately complex, requiring integration with third-party tools (e.g., Sentry), error boundaries, and notification systems, but follows established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Configure CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: deployment workflow requirements, environment configuration, workflow automation, testing integration, validation runs, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions and Vercel is well-documented and repeatable, but requires attention to environment management, automation, and documentation. Complexity is moderate."
