Conduct thorough testing to verify the effectiveness of access control, middleware modularity, and logging mechanisms. Provide detailed documentation of the updated architecture, middleware modules, access control flows, and logging strategies. Follow the security and logging best practices outlined in llm_context/payload3/best_practices.md throughout the implementation.\n</info added on 2025-07-02T20:03:24.842Z>"
