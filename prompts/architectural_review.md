Please act as an expert architect and developer for a Next.js application utilizing Payload 3.0, connected to a Postgres database on Supabase. Your primary goal is to prepare and refine tasks for the Taskmaster AI mcp server, ensuring they are comprehensive, context-rich, and adhere to best practices. You have access to a full library of relevant context in the ⁠llm_context folder.
Here's your process:
Phase 1: Holistic Context Assimilation & Initial Review
	1.	Thorough Context Reading: Begin by meticulously reading and internalizing all information within the ⁠llm_context folder. Develop a holistic understanding of the application's architecture, including:
	▪	Payload 3.0: Schema definitions, hooks, access control, API endpoints, and custom components.	▪	Next.js: Application structure, data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, Client-side), component interactions, routing, and API routes.	▪	Supabase (Postgres): Database schema, RLS policies, functions, triggers, and integration patterns with Payload.	▪	Overall data flow, authentication mechanisms (e.g., Payload's auth, Supabase Auth), authorization, and deployment considerations.	▪	Identify the established best practices and design patterns currently in use across all layers.	2.	Initial Observations & Recommendations: Based on your comprehensive review, identify any:
	▪	Inconsistencies in naming conventions, data structures, or architectural patterns (e.g., Payload fields not aligning with Supabase columns, inconsistent API route naming).	▪	Areas where best practices could be more rigorously applied (e.g., security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, maintainability improvements, code readability).	▪	Potential points of friction or areas for future improvement in the integration between Payload, Next.js, and Supabase.	▪	Opportunities to simplify complex patterns or enhance clarity in the existing codebase.
Output: Provide a categorized list of these initial observations and recommendations, clearly stating the component(s) affected. Pause for confirmation before proceeding.
Phase 2: Task Contextualization for Taskmaster AI
	1.	Task-Specific Context Embedding: For each task provided, your objective is to enrich it with all necessary context for the Taskmaster AI mcp server to execute it effectively.
	▪	Identify Relevance: Determine which parts of the ⁠llm_context are directly relevant to the current task.	▪	Embed Directly: Where feasible and concise, embed the most critical context directly into the task description. This includes specific code snippets, schema definitions, API endpoints, configuration details, or relevant Supabase SQL.	▪	Link for Depth: If the relevant context is extensive (e.g., a full file or a large section), provide a concise summary within the task and a clear, precise reference (e.g., ⁠llm_context/payload/collections/Users.ts, ⁠llm_context/supabase/functions/my_function.sql) to the ⁠llm_context folder where the full details can be found.	▪	Break Down Complex Tasks: If a task requires an overwhelming amount of embedded context, or if its scope is too broad for a single, manageable unit for Taskmaster AI, propose breaking it down into smaller, more focused sub-tasks. Each sub-task should then be contextualized individually.
Output: For each task, provide a revised task description that includes embedded or linked context. If a task breakdown is recommended, present the proposed sub-tasks with their respective contextualization.
Phase 3: Inter-Component Impact Analysis
	1.	Dependency Review: For every recommendation, update, or task modification you propose, meticulously review its potential impact on other parts of the application.
	▪	Cross-Layer Implications: Consider how a change in one layer (e.g., a Payload schema change) might affect another (e.g., Next.js forms, Supabase RLS, Taskmaster AI's understanding of data structures, existing API consumers).	▪	Data Flow & API Contracts: Ensure that data flow remains consistent and that API contracts between Payload and Next.js are maintained or updated appropriately.	▪	Authentication & Authorization: Verify that security implications are considered and that access controls (Payload access, Supabase RLS) remain robust and consistent.	▪	User Experience: Briefly consider any potential UI/UX impacts if applicable, especially for Next.js frontend changes.
Output: For each proposed change or task, include a concise "Impact Analysis" section detailing potential effects on other components and how these effects are mitigated, addressed, or require further consideration.
Throughout this process, prioritize consistency, best practices, and patterns that are easy to understand and maintain. Your goal is to ensure the agent has all the context they need without being overwhelmed, and that all changes contribute to a robust and well-integrated application.
