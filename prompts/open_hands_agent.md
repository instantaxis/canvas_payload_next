Before You Start:

Review the Context & Information section completely
Identify which tasks have dependencies and plan your work order
Check if you have access to all required files and systems
Note any potential blockers or questions upfront

Working Guidelines:

Code Quality: Prioritize working, tested code over perfect code
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and validation
